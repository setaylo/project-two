          Dawn has some cleaning up to do, but four chaotic forces of nature
          stand in her way. Meet the girls one by one and learn why they are no
          longer on speaking terms. Resolving tensions will take all of the
          patience and empathy Dawn is able to muster, but with your
          puzzle-solving and clue-hunting skills, you might just get through it
          all without anyone shooting the messenger.

        <p class="faq-answer paragraph-style">
          Adobe Photoshop for the pixel art and RPGMaker MV to code it all

        <p class="paragraph-style">Where do you guys get your ideas?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer paragraph-style">
          From out of our heads. Look, there’s no good snappy way to answer this
          question. Just try making stuff until it’s something you like and show
          it to people you trust. Wear your inspirations on your sleeve. And
          don’t take orders from a website!
